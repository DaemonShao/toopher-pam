Build
=====

Building requires:

* a build environment (e.g. make, gcc, etc. - the `build-essential` package on Debian-based systems)
* python development files (e.g. the `python-dev` package on Debian-based systems)
* pam development files (e.g. the `libpam0g-dev` package on Debian-based systems)
* the python packages listed in [build-requirements.txt](https://github.com/toopher/toopher-pam/blob/master/build-requirements.txt)

With these in place, the dance should start to look familiar:

Configure the package

    ./configure
    
The script needs a system group to be used for privilege separation.  By default it used `toopher-admin`, but you can specify your own (or `none`) using `--with-admin-group=GROUP`.

Make the PAM module and associated tools

    make
    
Install (with elevated privileges)

    make install
