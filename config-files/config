# This is a system-wide configuration file for Toopher PAM.  See toopher_config
# (5) for more information.  This file provides a way for administrators to
# customize the behavior of authentication flows that are configured to use the
# Toopher PAM module.

[API]
# API Credential File: The name of the file containing the API key/secret needed
# to perform Toopher API calls.
credential-file = /etc/security/toopher/credentials

# API Base URL: The Toopher API server to use for authentication requests.
# Most can use the default of https://api.toopher.com/v1/
base-url = https://api.toopher.com/v1/

[Options]
# Failure Policy: Determines the behavior of the authentication module if
# Toopher authentication cannot be completed for any reason (e.g. API server
# unreachable, misconfigured, etc.).  Valid values are:
#   * allow [default]: Authentication requests are granted if an error
#     condition is encountered
#   * deny:  Authentication requests are rejected if an error condition is
#     encountered
failure-policy = allow

# Availability: Specifies which users have Toopher available as a PAM
# authentication method.  Valid values are:
#   * none: Users are not allowed to use Toopher authentication.  The Toopher
#	  authentication module will ignore all authentication requests
#   * available [default]: The Toopher authentication module will use Toopher
#     to authenticate users which have completed the pairing process.  The
#     Toopher module will ignore all requests for non-paired users.
#   * groups: The Toopher authentication module will use group membership to
#     determine the authentication method used (see group options below)
#   * required: The Toopher authentication module will use Toopher to
#     authenticate all users.  The module will deny all requests for non-
#     paired users (careful!).
availability = available

# Availability Group: If availability is set to 'groups' then members of the
# specified group are treated as described in the 'available' section above.
# The default value is 'toopher-available'.
available-group = toopher-available

# Required Group: If availability is set to 'groups' then members of the
# specified group are treated as described in the 'required' section above.
# The default value is 'toopher-required'.
required-group = toopher-required

# Excluded Group: Members of the specified group are treated as described in
# the 'none' section above *regardless* of the availability setting.
excluded-group = toopher-excluded

# Automation Allowed: Allow users to automate the Toopher application's response
# to requests based on the user's context (e.g. if the user is in the same
# location that they previously were when receiving an identical request, the
# app can approve the request without prompting the user). This setting
# currently defaults to false because remote host detection is not yet at a
# high enough confidence level to ensure security in all cases.  However, many
# systems will find that automation can be safely enabled.
automation-allowed = false

# Show Prompt: Show a prompt to the user when performing an authentication request.
# The default value is false.
show-prompt = false

# Share Pairings: By default the `toopher-pair` utility will create pairings
# specific to the host from which the utility is run.  If this option is set to
# true then this changes that default behavior and the tool will create a non-host
# specific pairing that can be shared by multiple hosts.  This is useful for
# environments with many hosts that share user home directories and a single
# Toopher configuration.  The default value is false.
share-pairings = false
